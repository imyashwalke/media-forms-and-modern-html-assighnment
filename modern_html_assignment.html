    <h2>2. What are HTMl Entities? list out 5 commonly used html entities.</h2>

    <h5>HTML entity -</h5>
    <p>
      HTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML
      document. They are not present in your standard keyboard. They provide a
      wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes,
      mathematical operators, etc.

    <h2>
      3. What is web accessibility? list some of the assistive devices which
      play a major role in providing accessibility.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing web
      applications that can be accessed and used by people with disabilities or
      different needs, without barriers or limitations.
    </p>

    <h5>
      There are some assistive devices which play a major role in providing
      accessibility
    </h5>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h5 style="display: inline">Screen Reader :</h5>
        A screen reader is a software that reads out loud the content of a web
        page to individuals who are visually impaired. It can also interpret and
        communicate information about graphics, multimedia, and other elements
        on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5 style="display: inline">voice recognition software :</h5>
        Voice recognition software enables users to navigate web pages and input
        text using voice commands. This technology is particularly useful for
        individuals with mobility impairments or those who have difficulty using
        a keyboard or mouse.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5 style="display: inline">keyboard alternatives</h5>
        Keyboard alternatives such as sip-and-puff devices, head-tracking
        devices, and eye-tracking devices allow individuals with physical
        disabilities to navigate and interact with web pages without the use of
        a traditional keyboard or mouse.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <h2>
      4. list any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTMl.
    </h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h5 style="display: inline">text content :</h5>
        Having well-structured content that includes headings, paragraphs, and
        lists is one of the most helpful accessibility features for users who
        rely on screen readers.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5 style="display: inline">page layout :</h5>
        Although it is possible to design a layout using nested div elements, it
        is preferable to utilise proper sectioning elements to encapsulate your
        main navigation (nav), footer (footer), repeated content units
        (article), and other relevant content.
        <br />
        These elements offer additional semantics to screen readers and other
        assistive tools, providing users with more context and information about
        the content they are browsing.
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5 style="display: inline">ui controls</h5>
        When referring to UI controls, these are the essential elements of web
        documents that users engage with, such as buttons, links, and form
        controls.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <h2>5. Write a short note on the tab index.</h2>

    <p>
      Basically, the tabindex attribute is primarily intended to allow tabbable
      elements to have a custom tab order (specified in positive numerical
      order), instead of just being tabbed through in their default source
      order. <br />
      There are two additional options available for tabindex:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        tabindex="0" - this option allows elements that are not usually able to
        be focused via the keyboard to become focusable. This value of tabindex
        is particularly beneficial.
      </li>
      <li>
        tabindex="-1" - this option enables elements that are not typically
        focusable to receive focus programmatically, such as through JavaScript,
        or as the target of links.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <h2>6. list any 5 semantic tags in HTMl along with their descriptions.</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h5>header :</h5>
        specifies a header for a document of section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>main :</h5>
        specifies the main content of the document.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>footer :</h5>
        defines a footer for a document section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>p :</h5>
        defines a paragraph.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>aside :</h5>
        defines content aside from the page content.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <h2>7. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our webpage.</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        By using Semantic tags in our code, we can provide additional
        information about that document by defining the layout and sections of
        the webpage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Semantic elements are of great help to people using screen readers. The
        additional information provided by semantic tags helps screen readers
        understand the content better and help them to determine the different
        sections within a page more efficiently.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML Semantic tags help the browser determine the purpose of the page
        and its content. Semantic tags also help in Search Engine Optimization
        as they help browsers interpret the content more easily by making
        content more adaptive.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      8. Create a simple webpage with semantic HTMl which has the header, main,
      and footer sections. The header section must contain links to navigate to
      different sections of the webpage. The main section must contain three
      subsections about what is HTML. What is semantic HTML and a list of
      commonly used semantic tags? In the end, the footer section must contain
      your name.

        <h2>what is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          html stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard
          markup language for Web pages. it is used to create web pages. HTML
          describes the structure of a web page using markup tags, which are
          used to define different elements on the page such as headings,
          paragraphs, links, and images. HTML elements are the building blocks
          of HTML pages.

      </section>

      <section id="what_is_semantic_html">
        <h2>what is semantic HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of
          the content rather than its appearance. Semantic HTML uses tags that
          describe the purpose of the content, such as (header), (nav), and
          (section), rather than tags that describe how the content looks, such
          as (font) or (center).
